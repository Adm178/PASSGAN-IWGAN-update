# PASSGAN-IWGAN-update

The updated code for the repository can be found at https://github.com/Riathoir/PASSGAN-IWGAN-Tensorflow-2. 
All necessary libraries have been updated to their latest versions as of June 2023.

The main changes were made in the files train.py, generator.py, and discriminator.py. 
When running the code, the AI model is trained. However, the training process was not completed, so I cannot say what the final outcome of the training will be.

Nevertheless, I have ensured that the code is now in a state where it can be successfully executed and the AI can be trained.
